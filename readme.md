# Traffic Simulator

## Overview
This project is a traffic management simulator developed as part of an operating systems course. The simulator models vehicle flow at the roundabout of "Souvenir Fran√ßais" in Pau city, utilizing various scheduling algorithms to manage autonomous vehicles at a roundabout using threads and semaphores.

## Objectives
The main objective of this project is to design a prototype scheduling system capable of effectively managing a flow of autonomous vehicles through a roundabout, ensuring that only one vehicle enters the roundabout at any given time, even when multiple vehicles arrive simultaneously at different entries.

## Features
- **Multithreading:** Each vehicle is handled as a separate thread to simulate independent vehicle actions (arrival, traversal, and exit).
- **Semaphore Control:** A semaphore mechanism is used to prevent collisions and ensure that the roundabout can only accommodate one vehicle at a time.
- **Scheduling Algorithms:** Implements both First Come, First Served (FCFS) and Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling, with or without priority considerations.
- **Command Line Interface:** A simple CLI is used to input vehicle sequences and select scheduling options.
- **Gantt Chart Visualization:** Visual output via a Gantt chart to represent the scheduling and order of vehicle traversal.

## Compilation and Usage
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have GCC and make installed on your system to compile and run this project.

### Compiling the Project
Navigate to the project directory and use the following make command:
```
make
```

### Running the Simulator
To run the simulator, use the following command:
```
./bin/traffic_simulator -o [scheduler_option] -p [priority_option] [vehicle_sequence]
```

Where:
- `-o [scheduler_option]`: `0` for SJF, `1` for FCFS (default is `1`).
- `-p [priority_option]`: `0` for no priority, `1` for priority handling (default is `0`).
- `[vehicle_sequence]`: A string representing the sequence of vehicles (e.g., `A2c4E`).

### Examples
Run the simulator with the FCFS scheduler and priority handling:
```
./bin/traffic_simulator -o 1 -p 1 A2C4E
```
